𝌣 Insights & Recommendations:
💡 Churn Rate: 20.38% (2,038 churned customers out of 10,000)

💡 Card Usage, Tenure, and Age: 
  Customers between the ages of 45 and 60 tend to leave the bank at a much higher rate than customers in other age groups, with a 40–60% churn rate.
  Tenure, years the customers use the bank, doesn’t impact churn rates, as they are constant across all tenures.
  Churn rates tend to be lowest for the gold card types after customers have used for seven years, approximately 15%, 
  and the highest churn rate would be almost 28% for the silver card members in their first-year use.

💡 Customer Satisfaction:
  Customers who are active and haven’t complained anything about the bank are much less likely to leave the bank (0%) — Not One Of Them. 
  Meanwhile, the inactive customers who complained all left the bank, with a great percentage of 99.69%.
  Satisfaction scores don’t impact much on their decisions to leave the bank, with a steady percentage of 20% spread from 1 to 4 satisfactory points.

💡 Behavioral and Demographic:
  Customers with fewer points, ranging from 100 to 150 points, had a higher tendency to stop using the bank service, with a peak of almost 95% churn rate. 
  The rest of them contributed only a tiny even proportion of churn rates.
  Based on the geographical map, the churn rate in Germany stood out immediately, with the percentage, 32.44%, almost double that of France and Spain.

🔍 To conclude, the churn rates are influenced by highlighted factors that need to be addressed accordingly, particularly Germany’s high churn rates, 
customers having complaints, customers earning fewer points, customers making high product purchases, and customers falling in the 45–60 age group.
